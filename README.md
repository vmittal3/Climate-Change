Data Science - DSc - M2019 - IIITD


This repo contains my submission to the Data Science (DSc) Assignment 1 in Monsoon 2019 semester at IIITD. View the .pdf file for the main thing. The RMarkdown code is in the .Rmd file. assign_script.R contains my draft code. Other data files required are also kept here. 

When running the code, make sure you set your working directory to the directory where you're keeping all these files.
